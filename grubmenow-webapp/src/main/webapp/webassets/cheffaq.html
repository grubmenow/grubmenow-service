<h4>Q. What is grubmenow?</h4>
Grubmenow is a place to order fresh, home cooked food. Read the
<a href="http://grubmenow.com/#/faq"> consumer FAQs </a>
and
<a href="http://grubmenow.com/#/howitworks">How it Works</a>
for a quick overview.

<hr><h4>Q. Why should I sign up to be a chef?</h4>
Because you love to cook and don't mind some fame and money with a little bit of extra effort.

<hr><h4>Q. What do I need to do after I sign up?</h4>
You list your dinner menu at least a day in advance. When someone orders your item, we will notify you. On the day of the order, prepare your item and have it packed in containers we provide by 7PM. The customer who placed order will pick up the food from your address between 7 and 9PM.

<hr><h4>Q. How do I list an item?</h4>
We have made it really simple for you. Just send a text/WhatsApp message to our customer service number 209-900-GRUB(4782). Mention date and for each item you can serve on that date - item name, total quantity you can serve and price per item. We will take care of the rest. We recommend that you list your items a few days in advance so that more customers get a chance to order.

<hr><h4>Q. What kind of items can I list?</h4>
We are starting with dinner. So list items that you prepare for dinner such as Daal-Rice, Parantha, snacks like samosa, South Indian food like Idly, rotti, rice preparations. Anything that can be warmed quickly and consumed for dinner. Any cuisine, vegetarian, non-vegetarian is fine.

<hr><h4>Q. Do I have to list something everyday?</h4>
No. You are in control of your schedule. You can list on any day you wish to.

<hr><h4>Q. Is there a minimum quantity that I should prepare?</h4>
No. You decide based on your convenience. We encourage minimum 5 quantity for good customer experience.

<hr><h4>Q. What if I am unable to fulfil the order?</h4>
Inform us as soon as possible so that we notify the impacted customer(s). We hope this happens rarely.

<hr><h4>Q. How do I set the price of an item?</h4>
Think - will you pay this price for this quantity? Initially price the items to attract customers. You are competing with 100s of choices for the customer. Do not lose customers because of price. Once you build a reputation, you might be able to charge a premium.

<hr><h4>Q. How much do I earn?</h4>
The service we are providing is currently free. You will earn the full price of the item minus taxes and payment fees (for credit card payments). We will even provide food containers to you.

<hr><h4>Q. How do I get paid?</h4>
For online payments, we will send you a check on the 10th of every month.

<hr><h4>Q. What about food safety?</h4>
Glad you asked. Food safety is the most important thing for chef (yes, even more important than taste). We require you to read the guidelines on this site -
<a href="http://homefoodsafety.org/">homefoodsafety.org</a>
. Always list items that you can prepare fresh. Do not serve previous day's food. It is against our policy. We will also do an assessment of your kitchen before we list you.

<hr><h4>Q. What information about me will you share with your customers?</h4>
We need your name, address where you prepare food and from where food can be picked up, contact mobile number and email id. We will show your name in search results. Only for logged in customers, we will show your address so that they can decide to place the order. We do not share your information with any third party.

<hr><h4>Q. Ok, I read the FAQs. I am interested in signing up. What do I do next?</h4>
Call us at 209-900-GRUB(4782) 10AM - 1PM or 5PM - 9PM on any day or email admin@grubmenow.com.
