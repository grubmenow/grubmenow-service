    <h4> Q.What is grubmenow?</h4> <p>
    Grubmenow is a place to order fresh, home cooked food. If you are looking to escape the mass produced food sold elsewhere, Grubmenow is where you should order your next meal. Grubmenow ‘chefs’ prepare food at home. The food is made to order and is guaranteed to be fresh.

    <hr><h4> Q.How does it work?</h4> <p>
    On our homepage, enter your zipcode and we will show all the meals offered near your zipcode. Find a meal that you like, place order before the cut off time which is 6PM for same day dinner. Pick up the food between 7 and 9PM from the chef’s location that we will provide in your order email. See <a href="http://grubmenow.com/#/howitworks">How it Works</a> for more.

    <hr><h4> Q.What locations do you currently serve?</h4> <p>
    We currently have chefs in Seattle downtown, Bellevue, Redmond and Kirkland zip codes. More locations will be added soon.

    <hr><h4> Q.When can I order and when is the food ready?</h4> <p>
    Order by 6PM and pick up between 7 and 9PM on the same day. You can also order dinner for next day.

    <hr><h4> Q.Is the food ready to eat?</h4> <p>
    Absolutely. If you wish, you can heat the food in microwave before you consume. Our food containers are microwave safe.

    <hr><h4> Q.Why should I sign in to Facebook to place my order?</h4> <p>
    We require sign in so that we can process your order quickly. It’s also good to know that a real human is placing the order =) We provide your email ID and phone number to the chef so that they can contact you in case of any questions on the order. We do not share your data with any third party.

    <hr><h4> Q.Is it safe to enter my payment information? When will my card be charged?</h4> <p>
    Yes. We collect payment information on a secure page. We do not store any of your payment information in our servers. We use a service called Stripe that only gives us a payment token. We charge using this token as soon as you place the order. We will refund to this card when you cancel.

    <hr><h4> Q.Can I cancel my order?</h4> <p>
    Yes. You can cancel by 6PM on the date for which you ordered.Contact us and we will take care of it for you.

    We are sorry that you are not happy. Contact us with your order details. We will refund the payment for your order.

    <hr><h4> Q.Where can I find food allergy information?</h4> <p>
    At this stage, we are unable to provide food allergy information. Our chefs prepare food in their kitchens where allergens might be present. If you have food allergies, please contact chef for ingredient information.

    <hr><h4> Q.How do you check the quality of the food?</h4> <p>
    Food safety is very important to us. We take it very seriously. We take multiple steps to verify quality - we prescreen the cooking facility and food prepared by every chef before they get listed. We do random checks on the food as well as the cooking facility. We request every customer to rate chefs and provide feedback. We take every complaint seriously. When we are notified of any problems, we immediately take down the chef(s). See <a href="http://homefoodsafety.org/">http://homefoodsafety.org/ </a> for more information.
