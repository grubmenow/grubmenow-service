		                    Food safety is very important to us. We take it very seriously. We take multiple steps to verify quality - we prescreen the cooking facility and food prepared by every chef before they get listed. We do random checks on the food as well as the cooking facility. We request every customer to rate chefs and provide feedback. We take every complaint seriously. When we are notified of any problems, we immediately take down the chef(s). See <a href="http://homefoodsafety.org/">http://homefoodsafety.org/ </a> for more information.
